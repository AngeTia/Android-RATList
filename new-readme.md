# Remote Access Tool Trojan List - Android

This repo contains android trojan (and [Dataset](https://github.com/wishihab/Android-RAT-Dataset/)) as far as I know (free or paid app) with feature and permission list for my documentation.

Looking for port forwarding without buying VPN or Router setting?? Use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

# Note
Please don't download the project if you won't be infected by Trojan, make sure to recheck before downloading or installing from an unknown source (Trojan in a Trojan??).
